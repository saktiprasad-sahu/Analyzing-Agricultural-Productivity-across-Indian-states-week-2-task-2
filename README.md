ðŸŒ¾ Indian States Crop Productivity Dashboard (Power BI)
This Power BI project visualizes and analyzes agricultural productivity across various Indian states using key indicators such as annual rainfall, area, 
fertilizer and pesticide usage, and crop yield. The dashboard provides insights into:
--> Average Annual Rainfall vs Crop Production
--> State-wise Crop Yield and Production
--> Year-wise Trends in Crop Production
--> Fertilizer and Pesticide Impact on Agriculture
The goal of this dashboard is to explore how different factors influence crop productivity and to support data-driven decision-making in agricultural planning and policy.
